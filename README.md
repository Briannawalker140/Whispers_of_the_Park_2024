# Whispers_of_the_Park_2024
My 2024 Whispers of the Park multiplayer quake map.



## Texturing Immersion and Theme
The texture goal of Whispers of the Park is to make the players feel like they're fighting at an abandoned haunted house.  I used textures with darker colors like green or blue to make buildings feel older than they are.  Giving the pavement striping or parking lot lines beat up textures to give the feeling of decay.

In this screenshot the textures of the house, work well together to give the player an eerie feeling with the dark walls with bordered up doors.  Giving the same feeling a real haunted house would look and feel like.  

## Guidance and Orientation
The textures I used not only give the player insight of where they can explore next.  It gives them both the opportunity to see the little details and to follow any pathway if they don’t know where to go next or get out of a certain area.

(A pathway in the haunted gardens leading to the main entrance of the house.)

(Stairs that lead up to the haunted house.)

Using gravel as a texture shows the player the different paths they can take to find new areas on the map.  This also goes for John Romero’s design rule 1 of changing the floor height when changing floor textures, I applied this rule for my stairs. It not only gives it more details but adds better flow from the path to the house.   


 
## Lighting Immersion and Theme
My goal with creating the lighting was to make the map feel eerie enough for the player to enjoy.  That means darker areas for the spook effect and more lit up areas so the player can see more details in certain parts.

(Two different entrances to enter the haunted gardens and house.)

These two screenshots are my favorite because on the left it gives off the right amount of light to see the details of the wall and leaves the other side (haunted gardens) dark enough to make it look spooky.  Then there's the trailer that is brighter than anything else to give the burning effect.   

## Guidance and Orientation
My goal with lighting was to guide the player to different areas on the map.  Making a certain area brighter to tell the player there might be an item there or just making an area seem darker to make it feel spooky. 

 


(Inside the haunted rivers with a path running up to the house on both sides of the house)

In these two screenshots the main goal is to tell the player where to go once they have collected their items if needed.  Making the rocks bright enough to see as well as the exit back to the house.
