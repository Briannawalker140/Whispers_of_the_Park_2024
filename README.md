(Screenshot of the front of the haunted house)

In this screenshot the textures of the house, work well together to give the player an eerie feeling with the dark walls with bordered up doors.  Giving the same feeling a real haunted house would look and feel like.  

## Guidance and Orientation


(What to do)
1. Briefly explain how it was a goal of yours to make texture decisions that helped guide and orient the player. 
2. Add a (unlit!) screenshot or two of a section of your map where the textures work well to guide and orient the player.
3. Add a sentence or two that refers to the screenshot and explains how the specific texture work guides or orients the player. If your image demonstrates any of Romero's design rules, call that out and mention the specific rule!



# Lighting 
## Immersion and Theme


(What to do)
1. Briefly explain how it was a goal of yours to create lighting that evoked your theme and enhanced player immersion.
2. Add a screenshot of a section of the map that has cool looking lighting. You have to do this in the game engine (QuakeSpasm) not Trenchbroom!
