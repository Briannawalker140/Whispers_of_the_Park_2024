# Whispers_of_the_Park_2024
My 2024 Whispers of the Park multiplayer quake map.



# Texturing 
## Immersion and Theme
The texture goal of Whispers of the Park is to make the players feel like they're fighting at an abandoned haunted house.  I used textures with darker colors like green or blue to make buildings feel older than they are.  Giving the pavement striping or parking lot lines beat up textures to give the feeling of decay.

In this screenshot the textures of the house, work well together to give the player an eerie feeling with the dark walls with bordered up doors.  Giving the same feeling a real haunted house would look and feel like.  

## Guidance and Orientation
The textures I used not only give the player insight of where they can explore next.  It gives them both the opportunity to see the little details and to follow any pathway if they don’t know where to go next or get out of a certain area.

(A pathway in the garden leading to the main entrance of the haunted house.)

(Stairs that lead up to the haunted house.)

Using gravel as a texture shows the player the different paths they can take to find new areas on the map.  This also goes for John Romero’s design rule 1 of changing the floor height when changing floor textures, I applied this rule for my stairs. It not only gives it more details but adds better flow from the path to the house.

4. Add a sentence or two that refers to the screenshot explaining how the specific lighting work is enhancing the look of the section, conveying your theme, or enhancing immersion.

## Guidance and Orientation
(What to do)
1. Briefly explain how it was a goal of yours to make lighting decisions that helped guide and orient the player. 
2. Add a screenshot or two of a section of your map where the lighting works well to guide and orient the player. You have to do this in the game engine (QuakeSpasm) not Trenchbroom!
3. Add a sentence or two that refers to the screenshot explaining how the specific lighting work is contributing to player orientation or guiding them. If your image demonstrates any of Romero's design rules, call that out and mention the specific rule!
